## Purpose
This repository contains code to derive the data generated by the pipeline described in the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.06009">Falsesum: Generating Document-level NLI Examples for Recognizing Factual Inconsistency in Summarization</a> to appear in the 2022 Annual Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics (NAACL 2022). This code is not intended to be modified or reused.

## Usage
The code in this repository uses Python 3.

To derive the dataset:

1. Download the CNN Stories and the Daily Mail Stories from [https://cs.nyu.edu/~kcho/DMQA/](https://cs.nyu.edu/~kcho/DMQA/)
1. Unpack the downloaded files into a new directory
1. Run `generate_falsesum_data.py` to generate the dataset

Example execution:

```python
python generate_falsesum_data.py <dir-with-falsesum-jsonl-data> <dir-with-unpacked-cnndm-data> <target-output-dir>
```
